# realToGhibliGAN
This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for translating real-world images into Studio Ghibli-style anime images. The model uses a U-Net based Generator, a PatchGAN Discriminator, and a combination of L1 loss, adversarial loss, and perceptual loss to produce high-quality anime-style outputs.
